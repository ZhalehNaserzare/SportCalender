## Coding Exercise

1. Coding Exercise
Goal is to implement a calendar for sport events. Events may be added to the calendar and it should be possible to categorize the events based on sports.
Examples:
• Sat., 18.07.2019, 18:30, Football, Salzburg – Sturm
• Sun., 23.10.2019, 09:45, Ice Hockey, KAC - Capitals

2. Task 1 – Modelling
Start with identifying the database entities and then create a suitable database diagram (ERD). The ERD should cover all tables and their relations.
Furthermore, the database should contain additional information, which may be valuable for the sport calendar.

3. Task 2 – DB Structure/Data
Create a database following the structure of your ERD. Add all necessary fields to the tables. Foreign keys should be named with a ‘_’ as prefix (Example: _FOREIGNKEY).

4. Task 3 – Implementation
Create a HTML frontend to display the data in a user-friendly way. Navigation should be indicated but no functionality is needed.
Then go on with the dynamic display of data – avoid SQL queries within loops!
Required parts:
• Database connection
• SQL query
• Data output
Additional filters can be added to the calendar presentation.
